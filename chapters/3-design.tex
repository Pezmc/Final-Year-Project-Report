Chapter 3: Design
This chapter starts to describe the student's own work. It is where the main design aspects of the project are described. The style of presentation may reflect the life cycle of the project, for example commencing with the Requirements Analysis, but it should not read like a diary. The design should be clearly and precisely described with supporting diagrams. The presentation should be at a fairly high level without excessive detail. This chapter is a suitable place to justify your choice of architecture, implementation technologies and APIs used.
