This chapter puts the work into context. Having read it, the reader should be left in no doubt as to:

- the topic area to which the work applies
- why the work is being done
- what else has been done in the area and by whom
 - how the author proposes to tackle the problem: The project proposal is often expressed in terms of a main objective and possibly one or more additional objectives. It is useful to define "milestones" or "sub-goals" that mark the progress towards the objectives. 
 - It is common to end this chapter with a brief overview of each of the subsequent chapters of the report.

Traditionally the management of personal finances is performed by viewing bank statements provided by the users bank, however, even in this modern age of 'internet banking' banks offer a limited set of tooks that mimic the paper statements that would have been sent in the past.

This project sets out to build an online application that can be used to manage personal finances. Users can upload your bank statements, which are displayed in an intuitive manner, and once the application has enough of  historical data it predicts the users future outflow.
