\chapter{Introduction}

\begin{comment}
This chapter puts the work into context. Having read it, the reader should be left in no doubt as to:

- the topic area to which the work applies
- why the work is being done
- what else has been done in the area and by whom
 - how the author proposes to tackle the problem: The project proposal is often expressed in terms of a main objective and possibly one or more additional objectives. It is useful to define "milestones" or "sub-goals" that mark the progress towards the objectives. 
 - It is common to end this chapter with a brief overview of each of the subsequent chapters of the report.
