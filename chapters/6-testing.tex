Chapter 6: Testing and Evaluation
This chapter should give details of how the system designed and implemented by you was tested. The data and results obtained from this testing whould be presented and consideration be given as to whether or not these results confirm that everything works correctly.

The analysis of test results is very important and some assessment of their significance and quality must be given. Likely sources of error and inaccuracy should be mentioned. Use graphs, bar charts and histograms where appropriate, remembering to label all axes and give scales. The analysis is often done badly, thus sacrificing marks.
