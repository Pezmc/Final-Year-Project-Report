Chapter 7: Conclusions
This can be a short chapter summarizing what you have achieved and what you have learned from the achievement. It is different from the abstract. The main results of your work should be highlighted with a critical appraisal of them indicating the extent to which the objectives outlined in Chapter 1 have been met. Exaggerated claims are counterproductive here. Recommendations for further activity are often included in this chapter.

\section{Key Things Learnt}
\plan{How to do prediction, password entropy, other stuff}

\section{Does the system do what I set out to do?}
\plan{Does it make accurate predictions (summarise the evaluation section)}

\section{Limitations of research?}
\plan{Limited set of testers, just students and friends, add more stuff and then go global.}

\section{Further research}
\plan{Would like to classify users, would like to take into account global spending patterns}
% Gamification, global patterns

\subsection{Over-fitting models} \label{section:overfittingmodels}
\plan{Include why having too many models is bad and explore those a bit}

\subsection{Triple Smoothing} \label{section:triplesmoothing}

\subsection{Using Learning to Select a Scaling Parameter} \label{section:learningscalingparameter}

\plan{How learning algorithms could be used to fit the weights even more (custom one for each user!)}
