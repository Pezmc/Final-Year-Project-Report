\chapter{Conclusions}

Chapter 7: Conclusions
This can be a short chapter summarizing what you have achieved and what you have learned from the achievement. It is different from the abstract. The main results of your work should be highlighted with a critical appraisal of them indicating the extent to which the objectives outlined in Chapter 1 have been met. Exaggerated claims are counterproductive here. Recommendations for further activity are often included in this chapter.
