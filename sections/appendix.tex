\begin{comment}
Appendix A, B, C, etc.
These appendices can be very useful for giving detail that would otherwise disrupt the flow and readability of the report. They are given titles (e.g. "Appendix A: Example of the operation of the system") and bound in with the report. In general they are optional though, by convention, for a programming project, Appendix A often contains a non-trivial illustrative example of an input to the system and the corresponding output. For some projects, appendices may include tables of data. However, very long tables of data (more than about 10 pages) should be relegated to the Auxiliary Material, and not submitted as part of the Final Report. Program listings (apart from short code snippets) should likewise not be submitted as part of the Final Report.
